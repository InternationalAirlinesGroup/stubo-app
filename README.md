Mirage enables development and automated testing by allowing you to virtualize your application dependencies.

## Quickstart

For the really impatient ones - use our Tutum stack configuration (includes load balanced HAProxy environment with MongoDB and Redis dependencies): 

[![Deploy to Tutum](https://s.tutum.co/deploy-to-tutum.svg)](https://dashboard.tutum.co/stack/deploy/)

For less impatient, [instructions are here.](https://github.com/SpectoLabs/mirage/wiki/Installation)

[Try the demo project](https://github.com/SpectoLabs/mirage_demo) to see how Mirage works with applications and third-party APIs.
