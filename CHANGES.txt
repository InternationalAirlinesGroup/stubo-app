0.7 (2015-10-02)

Added:
- REST API for Mirage management. This API currently covers most of the management commands
  although it may slightly change (for example current "get response stub" request body is likely to be changed)
  This new API also has new functionality that was not available in the previous JSON API such as Tracker collection
  record filtering and pagination through REST. It also provides WebSocket supported filtering to speed up search
  in Tracker.
- Moved from Tornado template engine to React.js.
- New UI based on React.js framework. All web UI has been restructured, old /manage page was removed and its functionality
  split into "management" side menu where users can directly access scenario, module, delay policies or direct command
  execution pages. All of the data to this front-end is supplied by the new REST APIv2 and almost nothing is rendered
  on the server side (except for showing current Mirage version, however that may also change in future releases)
- Webpack configuration for compiling .jsx files to .js, this creates javascript bundles that can be easily imported
  in the separate pages and decreases loading time.
- Dockerfile for building Mirage Docker image and separate docker-compose script to launch dockerized Mirage environment
  that interconnects through container network.
- Syntax highlighting for

Changed:
- Deployment and application startup has been changed. Now, instead of executing setup.py, copying configuration to
  virtualenv and then from there launching Mirage by calling "stubo" command (that was far from standard approach at
  launching Python application) - it was changed to installing requirements from requirements.txt file with pip and then
  executing "python run.py" in the project root.
- Tracker collection is now being checked during each application startup. Mirage now checks whether it exists and can
  create a capped collection if it' not there. Then it ensures indexes.


Deprecated:
- Current web UI is currently deprecated, although not removed.
- Current handlers, handlers_mt, api functionality for serving and legacy UI is deprecated.

Fixed:

- Multiple open connections to MongoDB during tests
- Performance degradation due to indexing fixed
- Fault in multi-date rolling (BA issue)
